   * new version 2.0
   * changed default behaviour of ppurl: it now automatically creates
     GET parameters with correctly escaped &amp; for valid html
     apurl does not do this and preserves the old behaviour, which means
     that the template variable typically should be piped through an escape
     routing like the modifier |escape:'html'
   * code is now licensed under the MIT license
